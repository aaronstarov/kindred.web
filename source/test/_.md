Functions for testing.

The server and client sections each have **head.js**, **tail.js**, and **zend.js** files. Each **.test.js** is wrapped in the corresponding head and tail files, depending on whether the client or server file is being built. The end (zend) appears after all of the tests.

Test results will be stored in the global variable *Test.report*, initialized in **test/_/helper.js**.

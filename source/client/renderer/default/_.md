If certain fields are not defined in a renderer, the presentation will fall back on the behavior defined in **default/presentation.js**. Looking at this file is the best way to get a sense of how to define a renderer object. 

The default renderer provides minimal functionality for translating javascript objects to the DOM. The primary functionality of the default renderer includes event handling, and style and attribute definition. Example uses of some commonly used keywords are shown below:

```javascript
className: "className",

attr: {
    id: "element_id",
    type: "text",
},

onkeydown: function(e) {
    alert(e.keyCode);
},
 
innerHTML: "hi",

```

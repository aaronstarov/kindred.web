**Kindred Web** is the first implementation of Kindred, wherein we seek to demonstrate its core functionality with modern web tools, like **node.js** and the browser. Though many other implementations of Kindred are possible (and preferable), a web-based approach is the fastest path to a cross-platform minimum viable product. 

To get started, run: 

```bash
cd source
node dev.js
```

This will 1) launch the server on port 11248, 2) watch your directory for changes, and 3) recompile/restart the server whenever you change something. The build process concatenates files in order, placing files in subdirectories before higher files, sorting files and directories alphabetically. Thus, they'll appear in the same order they do in simple file browsers. You can see **build_details.md** for more.. build details.

**Note:** anything not ending in **.js** (code), **.md** (documentation) is ignored during the build process.  

The following sections correspond directly to the folder hierarchy of the source code.

**Kindred Web** is the first implementation of Kindred, which seeks to demonstrate its core functionality using modern web tools, like **node.js** and the browser. Though many other implementations of Kindred are possible (and preferable), a web-based approach is this author's fastest path to a cross-platform minimum viable product. 

To get started, run: 

```bash
cd source
node dev.js
```

This will:

1. launch our server on port 11248,
2. watch the source directory for changes, and 
3. recompile/restart the server whenever we change something. 

The build process concatenates files in order, placing files in subdirectories before top-level files, sorting files and directories alphabetically. Thus, they'll appear in the same order they do in simple file browsers. You can see **build_details.md** for more.. build details.

This automatic build system is a simplified version of [Meteor](http://meteor.com)'s. Unlike **Meteor**, both dev and production builds are produced: the dev version is unbundled for easier debugging, while the production version is minified. These builds are available under the **build/** directory.

**Note:** anything not ending in **.js** (code) or **.md** (documentation) is ignored during the build process.  

The following sections correspond directly to the folder hierarchy of the source code.

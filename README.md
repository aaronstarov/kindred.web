# Kindred Network

**NOTE: This project is still in early stages. What is written below should be interpreted as intent rather than reality.**

Kindred is a peer-to-peer internet framework for developing applications that scale effortlessly. Any application released through Kindred is distributed and maintained by the people who use it, meaning there is no need to manage or finance servers.

The central components of Kindred's architecture include:

- a unified data format for communicating structured information,
- a server that manages the storage and sharing of applications,
- a presentation framework for rendering and developing applications, and
- a single identity that can be used for any application across the network.

The quickest way to access the developer documentation is by cloning this repo, and running:
 
```bash
cd source
npm install
node dev.js
```

This will get you running your very own instance of Kindred, which can be accessed in the browser at *localhost:11248*.

You'll need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

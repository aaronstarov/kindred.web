# Kindred

**Note: This project is still in early stages. What is written below should be interpreted as intent rather than reality.**

Kindred is a peer-to-peer architecture that yields applications that scale effortlessly. Any application released on Kindred is distributed and powered by the people who use it, meaning there is no need to manage or finance servers.

The central components of Kindred's architecture include:

- a single network-wide identity,
- a secure, efficient communication protocol,
- content distribution based on market principles, and
- an intuitive presentation framework for developing applications.

The Kindred network is comprised of all machines that implement a minimalistic standard (documentation in progress).

The quickest way to access the developer documentation is by cloning this repo, and running:
 
```bash
cd source
npm install
node dev.js
```

This will get you running your very own instance of Kindred, which can be accessed in the browser at *localhost:11248*.

You'll need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
